# surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis:
Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, to analyze and visualize climate data as we prepare to partner with an investor to open a Surf & Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to generate summary statisics pertaining to the temperature in Oahu to determine if the weather conditions are sustainable enough to successfully open and run a Surf & Shake shop. To accomplish this task, we created and ran two separate queries for June and December and then stored the data into each of its own list to further create a dataframe. After creating the dataframe, we used the .describe() method to generate the summary statistics of the temperatures for June and December.
